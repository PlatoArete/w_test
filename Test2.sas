I'll add the exact amount matching requirement to the solution. Here's the updated SAS code that ensures refunds are matched to charges with the same amount:

```sas
/* Step 1: Sort both datasets by account and date */
proc sort data=charges;
   by account_id charge_date;
run;

proc sort data=refunds;
   by account_id refund_date;
run;

/* Step 2: Create all possible charge-refund pairs within the same account AND same amount */
data all_pairs;
   merge charges(in=in_charge) refunds(in=in_refund);
   by account_id;
   if in_charge and in_refund;
   
   /* Only keep pairs with matching amounts */
   if charge_amount = refund_amount;
   
   /* Calculate days between charge and refund */
   days_between = refund_date - charge_date;
   
   /* Only keep valid pairs (refund after charge) */
   if days_between >= 0;
   
   /* Create a unique ID for each charge and refund */
   retain charge_id refund_id;
   by account_id;
   if first.account_id then do;
      charge_id = 0;
      refund_id = 0;
   end;
   if in_charge and last.charge_date then charge_id + 1;
   if in_refund and last.refund_date then refund_id + 1;
run;

/* Step 3: Sort by account, days_between to prepare for greedy matching */
proc sort data=all_pairs;
   by account_id days_between charge_id refund_id;
run;

/* Step 4: Use a greedy approach to match each refund to nearest charge */
data matched_pairs;
   set all_pairs;
   by account_id;
   
   /* Track which charges and refunds have been matched */
   declare hash charges_used(dataset: "work.charges");
   charges_used.definekey("account_id", "charge_id");
   charges_used.definedone();
   
   declare hash refunds_used(dataset: "work.refunds");
   refunds_used.definekey("account_id", "refund_id");
   refunds_used.definedone();
   
   /* Process each account group */
   if first.account_id then do;
      /* Reset hash tables for new account */
      charges_used.clear();
      refunds_used.clear();
   end;
   
   /* Check if this charge and refund have already been matched */
   if charges_used.find(key: account_id, key: charge_id) ne 0 and
      refunds_used.find(key: account_id, key: refund_id) ne 0 then do;
      /* Neither has been matched yet, so create a match */
      charges_used.add(key: account_id, key: charge_id);
      refunds_used.add(key: account_id, key: refund_id);
      output; /* Output this match */
   end;
run;
```

The key change is in Step 2, where I've added a condition `if charge_amount = refund_amount;` to ensure we only consider pairs where the amounts match exactly.

This solution now:
1. Matches refunds to charges within the same account
2. Ensures the amounts match exactly
3. Minimizes the time period between charge and refund
4. Handles multiple transactions per account, even on the same day

Would you like me to add any other matching criteria or refine this solution further?
